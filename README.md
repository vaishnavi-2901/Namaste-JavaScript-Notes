## Introduction

This section covers the basics of JavaScript, its history, and its use cases. We also discuss the structure of a JavaScript program and some foundational concepts.

## JavaScript Engine and Runtime

Understand how the JavaScript engine works, what a runtime environment is, and how JavaScript code gets executed.

## Call Stack and Memory Heap

Explore the call stack and memory heap, which are crucial parts of JavaScript's execution context. Learn how functions are managed in the stack and how memory allocation works.

## Hoisting

Learn about hoisting in JavaScript, which allows function declarations and variable declarations to be moved to the top of their containing scope.

## Function Invocation

Dive into how functions are invoked in JavaScript and the different ways to call a function.

## Execution Context

Understand the concept of execution context, including the global execution context and function execution contexts.

## Closures

Explore closures, a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allows functions to access variables from an enclosing scope, even after that scope has finished execution.

## Asynchronous JavaScript

Learn about asynchronous programming in JavaScript, including callbacks, promises, and the async/await syntax.

## Event Loop

Understand the event loop, a key part of JavaScript's concurrency model, which allows for non-blocking I/O operations.

## Promises and Async/Await

Delve into promises, how they are used for handling asynchronous operations, and how async/await syntax simplifies working with promises.

## Modules

Learn about JavaScript modules, how to export and import functionalities, and the benefits of modular programming.
